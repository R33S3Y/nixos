# Reesey's NIXos Config

This is the repository where I keep my nixos config. Each branch is for each of my computers currently that only includes my 2 personal computers, Amethyst and Diamond although I may expand it to include some of my servers.

## Disclaimer

This repository is made public purely for my convenience and I will not bother helping any one with it in any form. Of course it is open source so can go crazy and do whatever you want to do with it, just know that I will not be helping you in any way.
